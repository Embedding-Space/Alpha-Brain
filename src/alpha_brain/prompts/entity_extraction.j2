- canonical_mappings: A dictionary mapping found names to their canonical forms

{%- if examples %}

Examples of canonical mappings:
{% for short, full in examples.items() -%}
- "{{ short }}" -> "{{ full }}"
{% endfor %}
{%- endif %}

{%- if strict_json %}

Critical: Return ONLY the JSON object. No markdown, no explanations, no code blocks.
